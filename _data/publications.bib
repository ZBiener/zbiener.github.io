	abstract = {In this paper we use George E. Smith’s notion of ‘working hypotheses’  to explicate the logic of theory mediation in Newton’s Principia. While much work on theory mediation focuses on how theory-mediated measurements fix theoretical parameters, we focus on how they allow phenomena to be constituted and individuated. This lets us locate in Smith’s work two types of evidence to which working hypotheses can appeal: what we call ‘conditional and ‘independent’ evidence. Considering their relative merits allows us to extend Smith’s account of theory-mediation. Ultimately, we argue that Smith’s nuanced portrait of Newton’s non-Cartesian methodology opens up a way of appreciating how choices of mathematical formalism can themselves be considered working hypotheses. }}

	title = {Mechanics in Newton’s Wake},
	abstract = {Newton’s remarkable achievements in planetary theory and dynamics were followed by a century of equally remarkable advances in the generalized science of forces acting on bodies in motion. Far from merelyformalizing the Newtonian framework, these advances aimed at solving deep problems left in Newton’s wake. First, Newtonian theory focused on centripetal forces, which are not characteristic of motion under arbitrary constraints or bodily deformation due to pressure and stress. Second, Newton’s attempts at fluid mechanics made clear that media could not be adequately analyzed using strategies developed for point-particles. Both considerations suggested that different forms of body required different analytical and conceptual tools. They required the formulation of generalized principles flexible enough to treat heterogeneous material configurations, but stringent enough to preserve the unity of mechanics as a study of matter and motion. Ultimately, Newton’s successors established a new discipline, analytical mechanics. Its primary object of investigation was the functional representation of the invariant relations behind dynamic phenomena, not the geometric representation of trajectories. The philosophical suppositions behind the new mechanics constituted a new mechanical philosophy, but one that hearkened back to, and completed the project of, the mechanical philosophy of the mid-seventeenth century.},

	abstract = {Public participation in scientific research has gained prominence in many scientific fields, but the theory of participatory research is still limited. In this paper, we suggest that the divergence of values and goals between academic researchers and public participants in research is key to analyzing the different forms this research takes. We examine two existing characterizations of participatory research: one in terms of public participants' role in the research, the other in terms of the virtues of the research. In our view, each of these captures an important feature of participatory research but is, on its own, limited in what features it takes into account. We introduce an expanded conception of norms of collaboration that extends to both academic researchers and public participants. We suggest that satisfying these norms requires consideration of the two groups' possibly divergent values and goals, and that a broad characterization of participatory research that starts from participants' values and goals can motivate both public participants’ role in the research and the virtues of the research. The resulting framework clarifies the similarities and differences among participatory projects and can help guide the responsible design of such projects.},

	first notice such a simple fact of logic? And why did he, and later generation, think
	it was such a big deal? The issue is of perennial interest to philosophers of science
	as the concepts of 'induction' and 'evidence' are intimately linked -- the problem of
	induction is not merely about projecting the past into the future, but about drawing
	any conclusions that extend beyond their evidential base. In this course, we'll
	investigate the origins of the "problem of induction." We'll see that there have been
	many forms of "induction" in the history of science. that not all of them were
	vulnerable to Hume's critique, that there have been several ways to mitigate the
	varieties of inductive risk, Figures will include Aristotle, Zabarella, Bacon, Boyle,
	Newton, Hume, Mill, and Norton. <a href="">Syllabus</a>

Despite a history of misinterpretation, scholars now largely agree that the purpose of the scholium is to establish and defend the definitions of key concepts. There is no consensus, however, on how those definitions differ in kind from the Principia's formal definitions and why they are set-off in a scholium. The purpose of the present essay is to shed light on the scholium by focusing on Newton's notion and use of definition. The resulting view is developmental. I argue that when Newton first wrote the Principia, he viewed the scholium's definitions as items of “natural philosophy.” By the time of the third edition, however, he came to view their methodological status differently; he viewed them as belonging to the more qualified “manner of geometers.” I explicate the two methods of natural inquiry and draw out their implications for Newton's account of space.},

	title = {Empiricism and Newtonianism},
	abstract = {The Enlightenment—the intellectual movement from which many of the philosophical, political, and religious doctrines currently held in the English-speaking world emerged—was born in the eighteenth century from the intellectual union of John Locke and Isaac Newton. With the Newtonian paradigm for mathematical physics, natural science underwent a period of unparalleled expansion and success. With Lockean Empiricism and liberal political theory, the fruits of that science were harnessed for the benefit and wisdom of humankind. This is how the standard story goes. Yet the union of John Locke and Isaac Newton was not a foregone conclusion. Newton’s philosophy of science developed while he was defending and revising his mechanics against philosophical critique, and Locke’s hospitality to Newtonian physics developed as it became clear that Newtonian physics was remarkably successful.
In this course we will investigate the extent to which Locke and Newton were intellectual allies, and how they came to be that way. Our reading will be focused on those drafts of the essay that were composed before Newton’s Principia was published, and on Newton’s own philosophical writings and their sensitivity to empiricist concerns.

From the dawn of civilization, philosophers, theologians and poets have conceptualized the good life and recommended ways to achieve it.  They have tried to teach us how to live happily and well.  In this course, we encounter some of the most influential thinkers in Western societies who have dealt with the questions surrounding happiness and good living over more than two millennia.  We read and discuss their thoughts as a way to help us develop our own philosophy of happiness and good living – a philosophy that will inform our personal life choices, console us when we encounter life’s difficulties, and guide us in our roles as friends and engaged citizens who care about the happiness of others.}}

We will see that modern science emerged from the interactions of several traditions of thought, some of which, like the magical tradition, seem at odds with modern science.

Consequently, it is used in virtually every field that tries to discover truths about the world, from physics and chemistry to sociology and marketing. But this was not always the case. Before the seventeenth century, it was commonly thought that mathematics lacked the representational power to capture the world as it actually is. Curiously, it was still held up as a paragon of knowledge.  Why was mathematics held up as an paragon and what did it exemplify? Why did philosophers think it was lacking? How did all this change? The course will address these three questions. We’ll begin with Aristotle and Scholasticism and end with the revolution in mathematics of the seventeenth century. Students are encouraged to develop research projects that engage directly with contemporary philosophy, as long as those are grounded in the history of the problem.. }}

I establish the following narrative: In De Gravitatione (circa 1668--1684), Newton claimed he had direct experimental evidence for the work's central thesis: that space had ``its own manner of existing'' as an affection or emanative effect. In the 1710s, however, through the prodding of both Roger Cotes and G. W. Leibniz, he came to see that this evidence relied on assumptions that his own Principia rendered unjustifiable. Consequently, he (i) revised the conclusions he explicitly drew from the experimental evidence, (ii) rejected the idea that his spatial metaphysics was grounded in experimental evidence, and (iii) reassessed the epistemic status of key concepts in his metaphysics and natural philosophy. The narrative I explore shows not only that De Gravitatione did not constitute the metaphysical backdrop of the Principia as Newton ultimately understood it, but that it was the Principia itself that ultimately lead to the demise of key elements of De Gravitatione. I explore the implications of this narrative for Andrew Janiak's and Howards Stein's interpretations of Newton's metaphysics.​},

The idea of embodiment is simple: to explain the behavior of bodies, we must understand them as unified wholes in their environments. Embodied approaches eschew explanations in terms of qualitative descriptions of the intrinsic properties of bodies and promote explanation in terms of the interaction between bodies. This idea can be found in Kepler's optics, Descartes' physics, and Newton's physico-mathematics. The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966) is the culmination of this centuries-long embodiment movement which can be traced back to the 17th century. },

I argue that Galileo's first science ought to be understood as the science of matter—not, as it is usually understood, the science of the strength of materials. This formulation sheds light on the convoluted structure of the Discorsi's first day. It suggests that the day's meandering discussions of the continuum, infinity, the vacuum, and condensation and rarefaction establish that a formal treatment of the “eternal and necessary” properties of matter is possible; i.e., that matter as such can be considered mathematically. This would have been a necessary, and indeed revolutionary, preliminary to the mathematical science of the second day because matter itself was thought in the Aristotelian tradition to be responsible for the departure of natural bodies from the unchanging and thus mathematizable character of abstract objects. In addition, the first day establishes that when considered physically, these properties account for matter's force of cohesion and resistance to fracture. This essay closes by showing that this dual style of reasoning accords with the conceptual structure of mixed mathematics.},

On one extreme, the system is portrayed as wholly axiomatic-deductive, with state- craft being deduced in an unbroken chain from the principles of logic and  rst philosophy. On the other, it is portrayed as rife with conceptual cracks and  ssures, with Hobbes’s statements about its deductive structure amounting to mere window- dressing. This paper argues that a middle way is found by conceiving of Hobbes’s Elements of Philosophy on the model of a mixed-mathematical science, not the model provided by Euclid’s Elements of Geometry. I suggest that Hobbes is a test case for understanding early-modern system-construction more generally, as inspired by the structure of the applied mathematical sciences. This approach has the additional virtue of bolstering, in a novel way, the thesis that the transformation of philosophy in the long seventeenth century was heavily indebted to mathematics, a thesis that has increasingly come under attack in recent years.}}

Voltaire, for example, famously identified Newton’s physics and Locke’s metaphysics as the intellectual framework for the Age of Reason. The association became such a significant feature of the intellectual landscape that in the eighteenth century a thinker’s relation to Newton was often a matter of self-definition; by way of affinity or difference, it was a means of locating one’s advertised position in the philosophical spectrum. The influence of naturalistic and experimentalist thought on Newton was similarly well known. Roger Cotes highlighted it in his polemical preface to the Principia’s second edition. And Newton himself, although he cited sources only sparingly, explicitly affiliated himself in the Principia with the mathematical-experimental tradition of Galileo and Huygens. Moreover, from the 1690s onward Newton used language borrowed from the Baconian/Boylean experimental tradition; and, as the first Part of this volume demonstrates, his first opti- cal works were set in a Baconian natural-historical mold and were read as such by his contemporaries and successors.
Yet the coupling of Newton and empiricism is not without problems....}}

Newton was an able and subtle philosopher, working at a time when science was not yet recognized as an activity distinct from philosophy. He engaged with the work of Rene Descartes and G. W.

First, the rules are not only interrelated, they defend various facets of the same core idea: that nature is simple and orderly by divine decree, and that, consequently, human beings can be justified in inferring universal causes from limited phenomena, if only fallibly. Second, the rules make substantive ontological assumptions on which Newton’s argument in the Principia relies. Along the way, several standard interpretations of the rules are challenged.},

This paper focuses on theconcepts of `matter' and `mass'. We suggest that students, likesome pre-Newtonian scientists we examine, use these terms in a waythat conflicts with their Newtonian meaning. Specifically, `matter'and `mass' indicate to them the sorts of things that are tangible,bulky, and take up space. In Newtonian mechanics, however, the termsare defined by Newton's Second Law: `mass' is simply a measure ofthe acceleration generated by an impressed force. We examine therelationship between these conceptions as it was discussed by Newtonand his editor, Roger Cotes, when analyzing a series of pendulumexperiments. We suggest that these experiments, as well as moresophisticated computer simulations, can be used in the classroom tosufficiently differentiate the colloquial and precise meaning of theseterms.},

The current volume has the explicit dual goal of peeling away a number of prevailing misconceptions and introducing Newtonian science to a philosophical audience. In both regards, it is a success. The Companion is bound to become a standard reference work, and it is indispensable for scholars and newcomers interested in 17th and 18th century natural philosophy. },

The first arises from the juxtaposition of Newton’s confidence in the certainty of his laws and his commitment to their variability and contingency. The second arises because Newton ascribes fundamental status both to the laws and to the bodies and forces they govern. We argue the first is resolvable, but the second is not. However, the second tension shows that Newton conceives laws as formal causes of bodies and forces. This neo-Aristotelian conception goes missing in Kantian accounts of laws, as well as accounts that stress laws’ grounding in powers and capacities.},
