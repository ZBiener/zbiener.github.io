	Abstract = {Big Data shapes every aspect of modern life. The products we buy, the news we read, our social networks, even the prison terms we are likely to serve if we run afoul of the law are all determined by data-driven formulas we neither control nor, for the most part, understand. In this course, we will learn the fundamentals of data and data analysis. We will also investigate their implications for how we produce and use knowledge to enhance our prospects for high-quality lives and for the betterment of educational institutions and democracy. Big Data, we’ll discover, is dwarfed by the questions it raises.

This course has an experiential, hands-on component and a reflective, deliberative component. The hands-on component focuses on problem solving and basic use of apps for data analysis and visualization. The deliberative component focuses on the moral implications of data science for justice in an open and interconnected society.

	Title = {Empiricism and Newtonianism},
	Abstract = {The Enlightenment—the intellectual movement from which many of the philosophical, political, and religious doctrines currently held in the English-speaking world emerged—was born in the eighteenth century from the intellectual union of John Locke and Isaac Newton. With the Newtonian paradigm for mathematical physics, natural science underwent a period of unparalleled expansion and success. With Lockean Empiricism and liberal political theory, the fruits of that science were harnessed for the benefit and wisdom of humankind. This is how the standard story goes. Yet the union of John Locke and Isaac Newton was not a foregone conclusion. Newton’s philosophy of science developed while he was defending and revising his mechanics against philosophical critique, and Locke’s hospitality to Newtonian physics developed as it became clear that Newtonian physics was remarkably successful.
In this course we will investigate the extent to which Locke and Newton were intellectual allies, and how they came to be that way. Our reading will be focused on those drafts of the essay that were composed before Newton’s Principia was published, and on Newton’s own philosophical writings and their sensitivity to empiricist concerns.

	Abstract = {We will examine some classic works on Descartes by some of the most prominent philosophers of the last several decades: Harry Frankfurt and Bernard Williams. Their work focuses mostly on Descartes’ epistemology and the Meditations, and so will we. We will address questions such as: who are Descartes’ targets in the Meditations? What does Descartes set out to prove? Does the so-called “Cartesian circle” pose a problem for him? Are his arguments for the existence of God essential to his overall project? How are Descartes’ arguments related to those of his contemporaries? Does he provide any lasting model for philosophical inquiry? etc. }}

The products we buy, the news we read, our social networks, even the prison terms we are likely to serve if we run afoul of the law are all determined by algorithms we can neither control nor (for the most part) understand.

Big Data, we’ll discover, is dwarfed by the questions it raises. The course will be devoted to a philosophical exploration of these questions and to their hands-on implications.

​We’ll work with a local organization to take an analytics project from beginning to end. We will divide into groups according to our disciplinary interests, and those groups will: identify our partner organization’s concerns, determine sources of data that can help address them, formulate mechanisms for collecting that data, analyze the data, present our results visually, and make recommendations. Our goal will be to see how the philosophical problems we discuss abstractly become concrete in the implementation of any analytics project. The progress and outcome of the project will be reported in an online portfolio and presented to the local organization.}}

	Abstract = {All of us dream of living “the good life,” though the mental images we have of it may differ.  Likewise, many of us have carefully thought-out strategies for achieving the good life as we understand it and work hard to implement those strategies.  But what is the good life and what do we need to do to be sure that our own life is a good one?  From the dawn of civilization, philosophers, theologians and poets have conceptualized the good life and recommended ways to achieve it.  They have tried to teach us how to live happily and well.  In this course, we encounter some of the most influential thinkers in Western societies who have dealt with the questions surrounding happiness and good living over more than two millennia.  We read and discuss their thoughts as a way to help us develop our own philosophy of happiness and good living – a philosophy that will inform our personal life choices, console us when we encounter life’s difficulties, and guide us in our roles as friends and engaged citizens who care about the happiness of others.}}

This course is about the roots of modern science in magical, mystical, and medicinal practices, and the contemporary chasm between science and religion in light of their past relationships.

We will explore these questions by looking at real-life scientific and technological innovations that shed light on the methods, procedures, and concepts of science. We will investigate types of experimental procedures and the evidence they can yield, the role of statistics, the relation between scientific "models" and reality, and the values and starting assumptions that influence scientific theories.

The core of Empiricism is the idea that experience is the main source of knowledge. However, we shall see that this idea takes any forms. It may be semantic (concerning the origin of mental contents or the ultimate sources of justification), methodological (concerning the proper methods of discovery and invention), or technological and practical (concerning procedures for manipulating real-world experiments or real-world goal like promoting health). We will pay great attention to the scientific context of 17th century philosophy, and the ways in which it encouraged the rise of Empiricism.}}

First, science apparently serves as an extremely reliable vehicle for arriving at the truth (as contrasted with astrology or palm reading). Second, the methodology of science seems eminently rational (again as opposed to the methodologies of astrology or palm reading). Some philosophers think that the two virtues are illusory and that, upon reflection, science is not significantly superior to astrology or palm reading. Our basic goal  is to survey 20th century philosophy of science as centered upon this idea. To this end, our focus will be upon the following question: are truth and rationality genuine features of scientific inquiry, or are they mere illusions? We will discuss topics such as: confirmation and disconfirmation of theories, falsifiability and pseudo-science, induction, probability and statistical inference, prediction, explanation, empirical equivalence, holism, relativism, and realism. }}

The first concerns “traditional” philosophical questions regarding what (if any) is the distinctive method of science and what epistemic attitutde is proper to take in regards the products of scientific activity. The second concerns information spread in society and how it is influences by the values of both scientists and laypersons. We also conver the nature of modeling and the spread of big-data modeling techniques as an instance of overall information spread. The third considers the value-free ideal of science, its pitfalls, and how science-in-practice responds to the values of the society in which it takes place, particularly the democratic values of equality, free-speech, and inclusivity.}}

In the first part of this course, we will study the scientific revolution and the epistemological and metaphysical views of the rationalists such as René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz. In the second part of the modern period, empiricism emerged as a tradition to rival rationalism; the pioneers of this empiricist tradition in philosophy were John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. After investigating the transition from rationalism to empiricism, we will study the metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language of these British Empiricists.}}

In this course, we will examine the evolution of the scientific perspective from Greek antiquity to the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. We will see that modern science emerged from the interactions of several traditions of thought, some of which, like the magical tradition, seem at odds with modern science. We will begin with an overview of ancient Greek ideas in philosophy, medicine, and cosmology. We will then look at how these Greek ideas were recovered and adapted, almost 2000 years later, during the Renaissance. The last portion of the course will focus on the profound intellectual transformations in Europe during the 17th century. }}

Consequently, it is used in virtually every field that tries to discover truths about the world, from physics and chemistry to sociology and marketing. But this was not always the case. Before the seventeenth century, it was commonly thought that mathematics lacked the representational power to capture the world as it actually is. Curiously, it was still held up as a paragon of knowledge.  Why was mathematics held up as an paragon and what did it exemplify? Why did philosophers think it was lacking? How did all this change? The course will address these three questions. We’ll begin with Aristotle and Scholasticism and end with the revolution in mathematics of the seventeenth century. Students are encouraged to develop research projects that engage directly with contemporary philosophy, as long as those are grounded in the history of the problem.. }}

The aim of this seminar is two-fold. First, it is to understand the Meditations as an isolated, free-standing text. Second, it is to understand the connection between the Meditations and the remainder of Descartes’ mature philosophical output. In other words, it is to understand the meaning and relations of “First Philosophy” and “Second Philosophy” in the Cartesian context.}}

	Abstract = {Aristotle held that nature can be studied mathematically by sciences that stand "beneath" arithmetic or geometry: optics, harmonics, astronomy, and nascent forms of mechanics. On an orthodox way of reading him, these 'subordinate' sciences differ from pure mathematics only in their restricted subject matters, which are nonetheless treated wholly mathematically. I argue for an alternate reading. I show that while a subordinating science's way of treating its subject matter is wholly mathematical, a subordinate science's is defined by it's  inseparability of physical and mathematical considerations. My textual case focuses on Aristotle's use of the subordinate sciences in _Physics_ 2.2. I show that Aristotle uses the subordinate sciences to exemplify a mode of thought that he believes ought to be definitional of 'physics,' one in which material and formal considerations are inseparable. However, I argue that on the orthodox reading of Aristotle the subordinate sciences cannot exemplify this. For context, I appeal to Euclid's _Optics_ as well as Plato's _Republic_. I further show that ancient optical practice involved an inseparable mélange of physical and mathematical considerations. I conclude that my alternate reading makes better sense of the _Physics_ and better represents the scientific context in which it was written.}}

\emph{definitions} for its key concepts. If so, why did Newton present
those definitions in a scholium, as opposed to the \emph{Principia}'s
list of formal definitions? In this essay I explored this puzzle, and
use it as an entry point to a larger set of issues concerning Newton's
methodology and the status of the things he chose or declined to define.
I focus on space. I argue that Newton views on space evolved between the
first and last editions of the \emph{Principia} (1687--1726). In the
1680s, Newton believed he was providing a \emph{natural philosophical}
definition of space, one that described spatial ontology as it truly
was; no caveats, additions, or deletions. By the 1710s, however, he was
moving toward adopting a more epistemically guarded position. He no
longer believed that his definition was unqualifiedly true, but that it
was only true given the assumptions implicit in his own physics. He no
longer believed his definition was natural philosophical, but that it
was more fitting of \emph{the manner of geometers}. I describe this
view, discuss its the implications, and provide circumstantial evidence
for the evolution of Newton's views.}}

	Title = {Mechanics in Newton’s Wake},
	Abstract = {Newton’s remarkable achievements in cosmology and dynamics were followed by a century of equally remarkable advances in the generalized science of forces acting on bodies in motion. Far from merely ‘formalizing’ the Newtonian framework, these advances aimed at solving deep mathematical and conceptual problems left in Newton’s wake. First, the success of Newton’s study of celestial and terrestrial motion in Books I and III of the Principia depended on treating centripetal forces, a constraint which allowed the use of his area law and geometric representation of force. But centripetal forces are not characteristic of all phenomena; for example, motion under arbitrary mechanical constraints or the deformation of a body due to pressures or stresses. Newton’s geometric representation of force was therefore not adequate for all phenomena, and a new form of representation had to be found. Second, Newton’s problematic study of fluid motion in Book II of the Principia made clear that fluids (and hence media) could not be adequately treated only as point particles and using strategies similar to those used for centripetal forces. Both considerations raised the possibility that different forms of body required different analytical and conceptual tools. This required the formulation of generalized principles flexible enough to treat heterogeneous material configurations, but stringent enough to preserve the conceptual unity of mechanics as a study of matter and motion.<br>

Newton’s eighteenth-century successors aimed to meet these challenges. They sought new laws, principles, and quantities: new laws to capture the complexity of interactions among forces and moving bodies of different sorts, new problem-solving principles to unify the treatment of these laws (least action, principle of virtual velocities, d’Alembert’s principle), and new quantities to provide the building blocks for both principles and laws (action, virtual velocities, absolute forces). They developed new formal tools by which to express all of these and by which to calculate the solutions to particular problems. In the end, they had established a new discipline, analytical mechanics, conceived as a branch of mathematics (Lagrange 1788). This new mechanics used differential equations for expressing functions that represented invariant relations behind dynamic phenomena. Its primary object of investigation was the functional representation of mechanical dependence, not the geometric representation of trajectories.<br>

The philosophical suppositions behind the new mechanics constituted a genuinely new mechanical philosophy, but one that hearkened back to the mechanical philosophy of the mid-seventeenth century. In many ways, the revolutionary project of ‘original’ mechanical philosophy was only completed by its eighteenth-century instantiation.

	Abstract = {I argue that Isaac Newton's De Gravitatione should not be considered an authoritative expression of his thought about the metaphysics of space and its relation to physical inquiry. I establish the following narrative: In De Gravitatione (circa 1668--1684), Newton claimed he had direct experimental evidence for the work's central thesis: that space had ``its own manner of existing'' as an affection or emanative effect. In the 1710s, however, through the prodding of both Roger Cotes and G. W. Leibniz, he came to see that this evidence relied on assumptions that his own Principia rendered unjustifiable. Consequently, he (i) revised the conclusions he explicitly drew from the experimental evidence, (ii) rejected the idea that his spatial metaphysics was grounded in experimental evidence, and (iii) reassessed the epistemic status of key concepts in his metaphysics and natural philosophy. The narrative I explore shows not only that De Gravitatione did not constitute the metaphysical backdrop of the Principia as Newton ultimately understood it, but that it was the Principia itself that ultimately lead to the demise of key elements of De Gravitatione. I explore the implications of this narrative for Andrew Janiak's and Howards Stein's interpretations of Newton's metaphysics.​},

The idea of embodiment is simple: to explain the behavior of bodies, we must understand them as unified wholes in their environments. Embodied approaches eschew explanations in terms of qualitative descriptions of the intrinsic properties of bodies and promote explanation in terms of the interaction between bodies. This idea can be found in Kepler's optics, Descartes' physics, and Newton's physico-mathematics. The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems (Gibson, 1966) is the culmination of this centuries-long embodiment movement which can be traced back to the 17th century. },

	Abstract = {Although Galileo's struggle to mathematize the study of nature is well known and oft discussed, less discussed is the form this struggle takes in relation to his first new science, the science of the second day of the Discorsi. I argue that Galileo's first science ought to be understood as the science of matter—not, as it is usually understood, the science of the strength of materials. This formulation sheds light on the convoluted structure of the Discorsi's first day. It suggests that the day's meandering discussions of the continuum, infinity, the vacuum, and condensation and rarefaction establish that a formal treatment of the “eternal and necessary” properties of matter is possible; i.e., that matter as such can be considered mathematically. This would have been a necessary, and indeed revolutionary, preliminary to the mathematical science of the second day because matter itself was thought in the Aristotelian tradition to be responsible for the departure of natural bodies from the unchanging and thus mathematizable character of abstract objects. In addition, the first day establishes that when considered physically, these properties account for matter's force of cohesion and resistance to fracture. This essay closes by showing that this dual style of reasoning accords with the conceptual structure of mixed mathematics.},

On one extreme, the system is portrayed as wholly axiomatic-deductive, with state- craft being deduced in an unbroken chain from the principles of logic and  rst philosophy. On the other, it is portrayed as rife with conceptual cracks and  ssures, with Hobbes’s statements about its deductive structure amounting to mere window- dressing. This paper argues that a middle way is found by conceiving of Hobbes’s Elements of Philosophy on the model of a mixed-mathematical science, not the model provided by Euclid’s Elements of Geometry. I suggest that Hobbes is a test case for understanding early-modern system-construction more generally, as inspired by the structure of the applied mathematical sciences. This approach has the additional virtue of bolstering, in a novel way, the thesis that the transformation of philosophy in the long seventeenth century was heavily indebted to mathematics, a thesis that has increasingly come under attack in recent years.}}

	Abstract = {Sir Isaac Newton’s association with “empiricism”—or rather, the set of traditions that constitutes “empiricism”—was clearly recognized during his lifetime and enshrined by Enlightenment philosophes as ideology after his death. Voltaire, for example, famously identified Newton’s physics and Locke’s metaphysics as the intellectual framework for the Age of Reason. The association became such a significant feature of the intellectual landscape that in the eighteenth century a thinker’s relation to Newton was often a matter of self-definition; by way of affinity or difference, it was a means of locating one’s advertised position in the philosophical spectrum. The influence of naturalistic and experimentalist thought on Newton was similarly well known. Roger Cotes highlighted it in his polemical preface to the Principia’s second edition. And Newton himself, although he cited sources only sparingly, explicitly affiliated himself in the Principia with the mathematical-experimental tradition of Galileo and Huygens. Moreover, from the 1690s onward Newton used language borrowed from the Baconian/Boylean experimental tradition; and, as the first Part of this volume demonstrates, his first opti- cal works were set in a Baconian natural-historical mold and were read as such by his contemporaries and successors.
Yet the coupling of Newton and empiricism is not without problems....}}

Newton was an able and subtle philosopher, working at a time when science was not yet recognized as an activity distinct from philosophy. He engaged with the work of Rene Descartes and G. W. Leibniz, and showed sensitivity to the work of John Locke, Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, and Henry More, to name just a few. In his time, Newton was not perceived as a scientific outsider, but as an active and knowledgeable participant in philosophical debates.},

	Abstract = {Newton’s Regulae philosophandi — the rules for reasoning in natural philosophy — are maxims of causal reasoning and induction. This chapter reviews their significance for Newton’s method of inquiry, as well as their application to particular propositions within the Principia. Two main claims emerge. First, the rules are not only interrelated, they defend various facets of the same core idea: that nature is simple and orderly by divine decree, and that, consequently, human beings can be justified in inferring universal causes from limited phenomena, if only fallibly. Second, the rules make substantive ontological assumptions on which Newton’s argument in the Principia relies. Along the way, several standard interpretations of the rules are challenged.},

This paper focuses on theconcepts of `matter' and `mass'. We suggest that students, likesome pre-Newtonian scientists we examine, use these terms in a waythat conflicts with their Newtonian meaning. Specifically, `matter'and `mass' indicate to them the sorts of things that are tangible,bulky, and take up space. In Newtonian mechanics, however, the termsare defined by Newton's Second Law: `mass' is simply a measure ofthe acceleration generated by an impressed force. We examine therelationship between these conceptions as it was discussed by Newtonand his editor, Roger Cotes, when analyzing a series of pendulumexperiments. We suggest that these experiments, as well as moresophisticated computer simulations, can be used in the classroom tosufficiently differentiate the colloquial and precise meaning of theseterms.},

Philosophers interested in the impact of Newtonian science on the development of philosophy thus face the daunting task of teasing the historical truth from three centuries of elaborations and myths regarding Newton and his intellectual legacy. The current volume has the explicit dual goal of peeling away a number of prevailing misconceptions and introducing Newtonian science to a philosophical audience. In both regards, it is a success. The Companion is bound to become a standard reference work, and it is indispensable for scholars and newcomers interested in 17th and 18th century natural philosophy. },

	Abstract = {Newton began his Principia with three Axiomata sive Leges Motus. We offer an interpretation of Newton’s dual label and investigate two tensions inherent in his account of laws. The first arises from the juxtaposition of Newton’s confidence in the certainty of his laws and his commitment to their variability and contingency. The second arises because Newton ascribes fundamental status both to the laws and to the bodies and forces they govern. We argue the first is resolvable, but the second is not. However, the second tension shows that Newton conceives laws as formal causes of bodies and forces. This neo-Aristotelian conception goes missing in Kantian accounts of laws, as well as accounts that stress laws’ grounding in powers and capacities.},

In addition it explores the use of Newtonian ideas in 18th-century pedagogy and the life sciences. Finally, it breaks new ground in analyzing the method of evidential reasoning heralded by the Principia, its nature, strength, and development in the subsequent three centuries of gravitational research.
