The **Publications & Talk** and **Teaching** portions of this website auto-generate from **BibTex** files. That means that I didn't input them by hand. Rather, I keep a list of my publication and classes in BibTex (as I would any other reference), and this website reads that list and makes the appropriate webpages. 

In order to do this, you must use the wonderful [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") to generate your webpages, and the [Jekyll-Scholar Plugin](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar "Scholar Plugin"). 

There are tons of tutorials on how to use Jekyll, so I won't repeat them. I also won't repeat the how-to for Jekyll Scholar. Instead, I'll direct you to the working example. Go to [https://github.com/ZBiener/zbiener.github.io/tree/source](https://github.com/ZBiener/zbiener.github.io/tree/source). Make sure your are on the **Source** tree. Now look at the files in the **Layouts** folder. Anything that begins with **bib** will show you how to apply Jekyll-Scholar.

Basically, Jekyll scholar makes entry.* available as a liquid tag. It is up to you to play with the tag presentation. The files that begin with **bib** show how individual entries are generated. The list of entries is generated by the **publication.md** file (or **teaching.md**) in the **_pages** folder.
