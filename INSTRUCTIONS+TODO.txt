# Full Deploy of site: 
1. commit and push source branch (already setup in Github Desktop)
2. rake git:deploy 

# Build site locally
bundle exec jekyll build

# Local builds can also be uploaded to master branch using GUI like github desktop. But rake commend automates this.

# If project branches get messed up, consult:

# Future: built in image compression, source commit, and other check to deploy:
