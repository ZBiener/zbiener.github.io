abstract="Observational astronomy is plagued with selection effects that must be taken into account when interpreting data from astronomical surveys. Because of the physical limitations of observing time and instrument sensitivity, datasets are rarely complete. However, determining specifically what is missing from any sample is not always straightforward. For example, there are always more faint objects (such as galaxies) than bright ones in any brightness-limited sample, but faint objects may not be of the same kind as bright ones. Assuming they are can lead to mischaracterizing the population of objects near the boundary of what can be detected. Similarly, starting with nearby objects that can be well observed and assuming that objects much farther away (and sampled from a younger universe) are of the same kind can lead us astray. Demographic models of galaxy populations can be used as inputs to observing system simulations to create ``mock'' catalogues that can be used to characterize and account for multiple, interacting selection effects. The use of simulations for this purpose is common practice in astronomy, and blurs the line between observations and simulations; the observational data cannot be interpreted independent of the simulations. We will describe this methodology and argue that astrophysicists have developed effective ways to establish the reliability of simulation-dependent observational programs. The reliability depends on how well the physical and demographic properties of the simulated population can be constrained through independent observations. We also identify a new challenge raised by the use of simulations, which we call the ``problem of uncomputed alternatives.'' Sometimes the simulations themselves create unintended selection effects when the limits of what can be simulated lead astronomers to only consider a limited space of alternative proposals.",

We start by briefly introducing a recent account of scientific progress in terms of risky and constrained lines of inquiry. This allows us to contrast aspects of {\Lambda} that make it relevantly different from other theoretical entities in science, such as its remoteness from direct observation or manipulability. We lay out a classification for possible ways to explain apparent accelerated expansion but conclude that these conceptually clear distinctions may blur heavily in practice. Finally, we consider the important role played in cosmology by critical tests of background assumptions, approximation techniques, and core principles, arguing that the weak anthropic principle fits into this category. We argue that some core typicality assumptions--such as the Copernican principle and the cosmological principle--are necessary though not provable, while others--such as the strong anthropic principle and appeals to naturalness or probability in the multiverse--are not similarly justifiable.}}

This question has received a great deal of attention in the physics literature, with attempts to prove no-go theorems based on classical general relativity and various hybrid theories serving as steps along the way towards quantum gravity. Despite the effort put into these no-go theorems, there is no widely accepted definition of a time machine. We explain the conundrum that must be faced in providing a satisfactory definition and propose a resolution. Roughly, we require that all extensions of the time machine region contain closed timelike curves; the actions of the time machine operator are then sufficiently ``potent'' to guarantee that closed timelike curves appear. We then review no-go theorems based on classical general relativity, semi-classical quantum gravity, quantum field theory on curved spacetime, and Euclidean quantum gravity. Our verdict on the question of our title is that no result of sufficient generality to underwrite a confident ``yes'' has been proven. Our review of the no-go results does, however, highlight several foundational problems at the intersection of general relativity and quantum physics that lend substance to the search for an answer.}}

It starts with an overview of the ``Great Debate'' in observational astronomy during the 10s and 20s, before turning to Einstein's ``rough and winding road'' to the first cosmological model, with an emphasis on the difficulties with Newtonian cosmology and the importance of Mach's principle. Conversations and correspondence with De Sitter forced Einstein to consider the status of Mach's principle in his new theory, leading to the introduction of his cosmological model. Although Einstein hoped that this would insure the validity of Mach's principle, De Sitter produced an apparent counterexample, a new model in which Mach’s principle did not hold. Einstein’s attempts to rule out this counterexample drew him into a tangle of subtle problems regarding the nature of singularities that also ensnared his correspondents Hermann Weyl and Felix Klein. Throughout the 20s, theoretical cosmology focused for the most part on understanding the features of the models due to Einstein and De Sitter and attempting to find some grounds on which to prefer one solution to the other. These debates came to an end with the discovery that several other viable solutions had been overlooked. This oversight can be blamed on Einstein's influential assumption that the universe does not vary with time, which was elevated from a simplifying assumption to a constraint on any physically reasonable cosmological model. This assumption kept Einstein, and many of the other leading lights of theoretical cosmology, from discovering expanding universe models. The concluding section briefly considers the fate of the consensus formed in the early days of relativistic cosmology in the ensuing decades, focusing on debates regarding the status of the so-called ``cosmological principle.''}}

There is a ``predictability crisis'' in eternal inflation, because extracting predictions apparently requires a well- defined measure over the multiverse.

The central idea of inflation is that the universe passed through an impressive growth spurt, a transient phase of quasi-exponential (``inflationary'') expansion which sets the stage for sub- sequent evolution described by the standard big bang model of cosmology. This inflationary phase leaves an imprint on various observable features of the universe. Observations can then constrain the fundamental physics driving inflation, typically described in terms of an ``inflaton'' field. Traces of an inflationary stage left in the form of temperature variations and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) are particularly revealing regarding the inflationary phase. There are currently many models of infla- tion compatible with the available data, including the precise data sets generated by assiduous observations of the CMB. Yet there are ongoing debates regarding how strongly this data supports inflation. Critics of inflation argue, among other things, that its compatibility with the data reflects little more than the enormous flexibility of inflationary model-building. These concerns have become particularly pressing in light of the widespread acceptance of eternal inflation, which seems to imply that all possible observations are realized somewhere in a vast multiverse.

The discussion is organized around an “ideal view” of physical theories and criticisms that can be raised against it. This view includes controversial commitments regarding the best analysis of physical modalities and intertheory relations. The authors consider the case in favor of taking laws as the primary modal notion, discussing objections related to alleged violations of the laws, the apparent need to appeal to causality, and the status of probability. The “ideal view” includes a commitment that fundamental physical theories are explanatorily sufficient. The authors discuss several challenges to recovering the manifest image from fundamental physics, along with a distinct challenge to reductionism based on acknowledging the contributions of less fundamental theories in physical explanations.}}

	abstract = {Newton frequently characterized his methodology as distinctive and capable of achieving greater evidential support than that of his contemporaries, due to its mathematical character. Newton’s pronouncements reflect a striking position regarding the role of mathematics in natu- ral philosophy. We can give an initial characterization of his position by considering two questions central to seventeenth century debates about the applicability of mathematics. First, how are we to understand the distinctive universality and necessity of mathematical reasoning? One common way to preserve the demonstrative character of mathematics was to restrict its domain, as far as possible, to pure abstractions. The subject matter of mathematics is then taken to be abstracted from the changeable natural world, consisting of quantity and magnitude themselves rather than the objects bearing quantifiable properties. Yet restricting the domain in this way leaves it difficult to see how mathematics relates to natural phenomena. How could the book of nature be written in a language of pure abstractions? Second, what is the proper role of mathematical reasoning in natural philosophy? Many followed Aristotle in consigning mathematics to a subordinate role. Mathematics could not fulfill the main aim of natural philosophy, namely to provide demonstrations reflecting the essences of things and nature’s causal order. A related concern was also pressing for the mechanical philosophers: a merely mathematical demonstration fails to provide an intelligible mechanical explanation. The very title of Newton’s masterpiece, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, would have been extremely perplexing: how could natural philosophy be based on mathematical principles? My aim is to articulate Newton’s position regarding the mathematization of nature in response to these two concerns.}}

	abstract ={Traditional debates, such as those regarding whether the universe is finite in spatial or temporal extent, exemplified, according to Kant, the inherent tendency of pure reason to lead us astray. Although various aspects of Kant’s arguments fail to find a footing in modern cosmology, Kant’s objections to the search for a complete objective description of the cosmos are related to three intertwined issues that are still of central importance: the applicability of universal laws, the status of distinctively cosmological laws, and the explanatory sufficiency of laws. We will advocate a broadly Kantian position on these three issues as part of a critical response to a prevalent strain of Leibnizian rationalism in contemporary cosmology.}}

	abstract ={This paper considers the problem of underderdetermination, and its ramifications for cosmology, from a perspective that departs from the conventional wisdom in philosophy.  In many historical cases, the data have sufficed to determine the correct theory within a given domain, in a sense that I will make precise.  This argument depends on two main claims.  First, the theory that can be determined in this sense consists of law-like relationships postulated to hold among physical properties.  The over-determination argument does not similarly support explanatory theories, or general theoretical frameworks.  Second, scientists typically ``trust'' such theories in that they presuppose them to gain access to an entirely new domain of phenomena.  The precise lawlike relationships of the theory allow scientists to draw inferences regarding some target phenomena based on relatively accessible data.  The initial evidence in favor of accepting the theory may be quite weak.  Yet, I will argue, in several historical cases, subsequent research based on the theory leads to powerful evidence in its favor.  This evidence can be sufficient to support the claim that the theory is a permanent contribution to science.  I will further argue that this evidence is far stronger than predictive success; the use of the theory in developing an account of some domain of phenomena also supports the claim that it has identified (at least approximately) correct counter-factual dependencies.  One aim of the paper, extending beyond the conference talk, is to defend this line of thought in more detail, and consider how it contrasts with Dawid's treatment of underdetermination.  The second aim is to explore how this line of thought applies to contemporary cosmology.  I will argue that, by contrast with the historical cases of over-determination, some versions of inflationary cosmology do not qualify as an ``exact theory,'' in that they fail to propose law-like dependencies among physical properties.}}

	abstract = {Stein has characterized one of the central problems in accounting for our knowledge in physics as that of getting the laboratory, or observatory, inside the theory -- that is, of understanding how the mathematical structures of fundamental physical theories have empirical content. He has argued that physicists respond to this problem by giving schematic representations of observers and experiments. In addition, Stein emphasizes the importance of regarding knowledge as an enterprise, with current theories providing guidance for future inquiry. I will explore some ramifications of this way of thinking about the structure of scientific theories for contemporary cosmology. One goal of observational cosmology is to measure the six basic parameters appearing in the standard model of cosmology. These parameters are well-defined if the universe is suitably approximated at some scale by a perturbed FLRW model. The enormous extrapolations involved in the standard model are often justified by the consistent determination of these parameters via a variety of methods. Here I will consider two recent debates regarding this approach to cosmology, inspired by Stein's work. The first debate regards the impact of different ways of characterizing the propagation of light through a cosmological spacetime on the determination of cosmological parameters (such as H_0). The second regards how the highly symmetric FLRW models relate to describing the real universe, at small scales where it is very lumpy.}}

The fate of determinism is interwoven with the question of what it is for a spacetime to be ‘physically reasonable’. A central concern is the status of global hyperbolicity, a putatively necessary condition for determinism in GR. While global hyperbolicity may fail to be true of all physically reasonable models, we analyze whether global hyperbolicity should be (i) imposed by fiat; (ii) established from weaker assumptions, as in cosmic censorship theorems; or (iii) justified by beyond-GR physics.}
