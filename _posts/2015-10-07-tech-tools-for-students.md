excerpt: Some academics have a "system" they use to keep track of research, writing, feedback, revisions, etc. Students can spend years figuring out what a good "system" is, partly because academics are bad at sharing, After some conversation with students, I decided to devote some posts to my "system." I recommend cherry-picking parts that make sense to you.
